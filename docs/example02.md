# Example 2

This example will illustrate how to use a job array to run the same
command or set of commands on a list of subjects from a file. This
is possibly the most common scenario for using the cluster.

The purpose of this is to illustrate how to use the list of subjects,
so expect that there will be much more complicated tasks done to
each than what is shown here.

This scenario requires a list of something. Often the list will be
of subjects, but it may also be a list of files, which is what we
will use here.
