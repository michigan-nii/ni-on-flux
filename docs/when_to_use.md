# When should you use the cluster?

Many people wonder why they should both with the cluster at all.  I mean,
it's inconvenient, it takes more time to find and fix mistakes, and it's
got all these bureaucratic details like accounts and so forth to deal with.

Most people who use the cluster for one of three reasons.

1. They have a lot of subjects to analyze, anywhere from a few hundred
   to many thousands.  They simply could not do the work with their
   lab computers.

1. The analysis they want to do requires more memory or more disk than
   their lab machines can provide.  The cluster has computers with
   anywhere from 48 GB of memory to 1500 GB of memory; the cluster
   has a multipetabyte (1,000,000 GB) disk.

1. You need your own computers for something else.  If you set your
   computer to running analyses that will take a week, they may not
   be usable for other things that are equally important.
